this program merges symbol and event data to create an integrated data set.

All the csv files in [Extract Symbol Data] folder are merged with the ecdf.csv in folder [Build Event Data] to create ecsymdf.csv

Note:

make sure to put your csv files(daily symbol data and hourly symbol data) from "Extract Symbol Data" in current directory. and initialize 'symbolDataFileDaily' and 'symbolDataFileHourly' with corresponding file address at the top lines of 'msaed.py'.
